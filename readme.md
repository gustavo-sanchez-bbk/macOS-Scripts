# macOS Admin Scripts 🖥️🍏

A collection of scripts, tools, and experiments for managing and automating macOS endpoints in enterprise environments.

This is very much a work in progress !!! 

These scripts are primarily focused around:

- **macOS fleet management** (Jamf Pro, Intune, MDM)
- **Security & compliance** (CIS baselines, ISO27001 support, EDR)
- **Automation & integrations** (Slack, APIs, CI pipelines)
- **User experience improvements** (zero-touch onboarding, self-service, prompts)

** ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
**These scripts are provided *as-is*, with no warranty or guarantees. Test everything in a lab / non-production environment before rolling out to real users.****
